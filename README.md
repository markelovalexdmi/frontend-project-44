## Description

This JavaScript project features a collection of text-based games, including:

1. **Even or Not**: A game that determines whether a given number is even or odd.

2. **Calculator**: A game that performs basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two user-provided numbers.

3. **Greatest Common Divisor**: A game that finds the largest number that divides both the given numbers without leaving a remainder.

4. **Missing Number in Progression**: A game that determines the missing number in an arithmetic progression.

5. **Prime Number**: A game that determines whether a given number is prime or not.

All of these games provide a fun and interactive way for users to practice their math skills.
