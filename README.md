2. **Calculator**: A user tries to determine the result of mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication).

3. **Greatest Common Divisor**: A user tries to determine the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

4. **Missing Number in Progression**: A user tries to determine the missing number in an arithmetic progression.

5. **Prime Number**: A user tries to determine whether a given number is prime or not.

All of these games provide a fun and interactive way for users to practice their math skills.
